# Drug Usage with Baby Boomers

**Introduction**

Independent Data Science project undertaken to investigate drug usage among the Baby Boomer generation in the recent past. 

The `drug_usage` data set comes from the [Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/SAMHDA/index.html) provided by the University of Michigan. 

To make sure that the results were correct, I compared my final graph to the one in this [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-baby-boomers-get-high/)
